Low-income loans are personal loans that are available to borrowers with lower-than-average incomes. Thereâ€™s no specific threshold for what constitutes a low income, since each lender sets its own rules. 

LendingPoint, for example, requires a minimum annual income of $5,000.1 Upstart, on the other hand, has a much lower requirement of $1,000 per year.2 Certain other lenders have no specific minimum and review many factors before making a decision on your loan application.
