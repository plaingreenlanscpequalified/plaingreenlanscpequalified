While a low income can make it difficult to qualify for a personal loan, you may still have options. Some lenders offer low-income loans to borrowers who can meet their other requirements, usually related to credit and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. 

Online lenders and credit unions may be especially flexible when it comes to income requirements, so it’s worth shopping around to explore your loan options. Whether you’re looking for a loan to consolidate debt, cover an emergency expense, or any other purpose, a low income doesn't have to stand in your way.
